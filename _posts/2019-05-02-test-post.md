# Intersection Over Union aka IoU

A lot of blog post already avalible which are related to the IoU topic. Current post does not prettend to be treasure chest of  but here I've wrote down couple of notes which helped me understand the angorithm better and implement it bymyself.

## Goal
1. Understand idea behind the algoritm
2. Implement algoritm from scratch

## Idea hehid the algoritm
The aim of IoU algoritm is to show how bound box(`A`) is simmilar or different from bound box (`B`). IoU produse one value in range from 0 to 1. Where 0 means totaly differnt boud boxes and 1 means - this is the same bound box. In other words IoU algoritm is just a simmilarity function with 2 arguments `A` and `B`.
We could define this function in next way:

```python
def iou(bbox_a:list, bbox_b:list)->float:
    # calculate IoU here
    pass
```
