# Intersection Over Union aka IoU

A lot of blog post already avalible which are related to the IoU topic. Current post does not prettend to be treasure chest of  but here I've wrote down couple of notes which helped me understand the angorithm better and implement it bymyself.

## Goal
1. Understand idea behind the algoritm
2. Implement algoritm from scratch

## Idea behid the algoritm
The aim of IoU algoritm is to show how bound box(`A`) is simmilar or different from bound box (`B`). IoU produse one value in range from 0 to 1. Where 0 means totaly differnt boud boxes and 1 means - this is the same bound box. In other words IoU algoritm is just a simmilarity function with 2 arguments `A` and `B` that returns float value.
We could define this function in next way:

```python
def iou(bbox_a:list, bbox_b:list)->float:
    # calculate IoU here
    pass
```

Let's define two variable corespondint to bounding boxes and use `[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]` convetion for bound box definition:

```python
bbox_a = [0, 512, 0, 512]
bbox_b = [256, 768, 256, 768]
```

Each bbox could be shown as rectangle area which could be calculated as `rectangle_width * rectangle_height`. Height and width could be calculated from bbox(e.g. `xmax-xmin`) if neccesary, but let's skip it for a current momment.

Intersection is the area where two bboxes are overlaped

Based of algorith name we have to find 2 values:
- ***intersection*** of two bboxes(the area where two bboxes are overlaped)
- ***union*** of two bboxes(bbox areas sum - intersection)

We know how to calculate area of the rectangle, but it will give us only sum or bbox areas but not intersection nor union.
